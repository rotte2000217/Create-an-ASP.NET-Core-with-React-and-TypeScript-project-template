# Create an ASP.NET Core with React and TypeScript project template
## About
`crtsdn.sh` is a bash script which automatically creates an ASP.NET Core with React TypeScript project template. Currently, the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/react?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio) only shows how to create a JavaScript React app with ASP.NET Core.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- npm (Create React App requires Node 14 or higher.)
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
- dotnet

See installation instructions: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download.

### Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/raihahahan/dotnet-react-typescript
```
### Usage
```
sh crtsdn.sh project-name
```
